                pages
                visited, browser details, your IP address) and your interactions with any emails that We send to
                you. This information may include IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP),
                referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating
                system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer
                the site. <br>
                <b>• Promotions:</b> From time to time, Optimal Lifestyle may offer promotions, such as surveys or
                sweepstakes, on
                the Services. Such promotions may ask for your name, contact information, and/or other Personal
                Information in order to register you for the promotion. <br>
                <b>• Social Media and Sharing:</b> If you share an article, or post a comment or other content with
                a
                friend/contact, We will collect your friend's/contact's name. This information may be used for
                retargeting ads or combined with other data to present aggregated campaign insights. Occasionally,
                comments themselves may be anonymized and used in marketing materials. <br>
                <b>• Device Information:</b> We collect information from or about the computers, phones, or other

                from
                third-party partners, such as information from a partner when We jointly offer services or from an
                advertiser about your experiences or interactions with them. We may add this information to the
                information We have already collected from you in order to improve the products and services We
                provide. Third-party services and organizations we collect this information from play a crucial role
                to supplement information provided by you. For example, if you access our Services through a
                Third-Party application, such as an App Store or social network site (“SNS”), we may collect
                information about you from that third-party application that you have made public via your privacy
                settings. Information we collect through App Stores or SNS accounts may include your name, your SNS
                user identification number, your SNS user name, location, sex, birth date, email, profile picture,
                and your contacts on the SNS. This supplemental information allows us to verify information that you
                have provided to Us and to enhance our ability to provide you with information about our
                business and Services.

                information (diagnosis, when you were diagnosed, what medications you're taking) when you download,
                sign up for, and use our Apps. When you download and use our Apps, you will be presented with
                additional privacy terms applicable to that specific App, and We automatically collect information
                on the type of device you use and operating system version. We use the above information to send you
                newsletters, respond to customer service requests, administer your account, respond to your
                questions and concerns, etc.

                browser window to when they exit the browser) and persistent cookies that remain on your hard drive
                until you erase them or they expire. How long a persistent cookie remains on your browser depends on
                how long the visited website has programmed the cookie to last or they can be stored for longer.

                web beacon also referred to as a pixel tag is a piece of code embedded on the Website that collects
                information about users’ engagement on that web page. The use of a pixel allows Us to record, for
